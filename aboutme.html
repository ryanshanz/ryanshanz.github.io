            <p> I am a student at the University of Maine, graduating in May 2025 with a degree in Computer Science. 
                I am interested in software development, cybersecurity, and information technology, and am currently 
                seeking full-time positions. I have worked on projects related to web development, cybersecurity,
                automation tasks, video game AI algorithms, and more. I also have experience writing user documentation
                and conducting code reviews. When I am not coding, I enjoy watching movies, reading, and playing basketball.
                Feel free to reach out and connect with me!
